    <p>
        With the improvement of mobile phone penetration. We experience a lot of photos on the internet. Today, everyone can shoot a photo, but what will let your photo stand out? What will make you a good photographer? There are three basic principles of a good photo:<br>

        <ol>
            <li>A good photo should have a distinct subject, that the subject is very clear and unambiguous to the viewer. It can a person, a group of people, a thing, a group of things, or a story.</li>
            <li>The viewer’s attention should be directed to the subject of the photo. The viewer should able to identify the subject at first glance.</li>
            <li>The frame of the photo should be concise. That anything will distract viewer’s attention toward the subject should be eliminated.</li>
        </ol><br>
    </p>
    
    <p>When you press your shutter, you should always remind you three questions:</p><br>

    <p>
        <ol>
        <li>What subject am I presenting?</li>
        <li>How could I attract viewer’s attention toward the subject?</li>
        <li>Is there anything will distract viewer’s attention toward the subject?</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
