    <h1>The Four Shooting Modes in Mirrorless Camera (P, A, S, and M Modes)</h1>
    <p>
        There are the four common shooting modes among digital camera. Almost every mirrorless camera has these modes. Each of mode will be applicable to different situation. I will start introduce the most difficult mode M to the easiest mode P.

    <h2>Mode M (Manual)</h2>
    <p>A commonly used shooting mode for seasoned photographer. It provides the great latitude for creative expression. It can be used to shoot various objects. The photographer can manually select the aperture and shutter speed. In most mirrorless camera, you can set the ISO to manual or auto. I highly recommend beginners to set it on auto. It will help you to understand ISO deeply. Mode M can be time consuming for beginners but it is the most effective mode to help you to learn photography and form you own unique photography style. Simply rotate your mode dial on the camera to M. Focusing on the object. Then starts to adjust the aperture, shutter speed and ISO. </p>

    <br>

    <h2>Mode A (Aperture-Priority Auto)</h2>
    <p>Mode A allows the photographer to select the aperture, and the camera will automatically set the shutter speed for optimal exposure. Keep in mind, that is the optimal exposure for camera but maybe not the photographer. Photographers have the right to determine the optimal exposure. Mode A is often less time consuming. It can be used to shoot still or slow-moving object. Such as landscape or pedestrian. Switching to Mode A, simply rotate your mode dial to A.</p>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>Mode S (Shutter-Priority Auto)</h2>
    <p>Mode S allows the photographer to select the shutter speed, and the camera will automatically set the aperture for optimal exposure. It is also less time consuming just like Mode A because you only have to set one thing. It can be used for shooting fast moving object. Such as motorcycles, birds, and athletes. Switching to Mode S, simply rotate your mode dial to S.</p>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>Mode P (Shutter-Priority Auto)</h2>
    <p>The camera will automatically select the aperture and shutter speed for you. But the photographer can choose different combination of an aperture and shutter speed that produce the same exposure. I do not recommend beginners to use this mode. It will restrict your creativity. That the camera will select all the things for you. In fact, cameras are not smart as human currently. In order to form a specific photography style, you should have more control over the camera.</p>
