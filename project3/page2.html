    <h1>
        The Three Basic Elements of Exposure (Aperture, shutter speed, ISO)</h1>
    <p>
        When shooting a photo with a mobile phone. You will not notice the aperture, shutter
        speed and, ISO. That does not mean they do not exist in the phone camera. You are
        just not allowed to adjust them individually on your phone because they are automatically
        set. In order to have greater latitude for creative expression, you have to learn
        the three elements.

    <h2>
        Aperture</h2>

        Aperture Value on the Lens</p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Aperture is the hole which controls the brightness passes through the lens. You
        can find the aperture ring on the lens. Aperture are usually written as “f/” followed
        by a number, such as f/1.4, f/2, f/2.8, f/4, f/5.6, f/8, f/11, f/16, f/22. Keep
        in mind, the smaller aperture, the larger f number. The larger aperture, the smaller
        f number. This can be confusing for beginners. For example, f/1.4 is a quite large
        aperture whereas f/22 is a quite small aperture. A larger aperture means that there
        are more light passes through the lens and falls on the image sensor than a smaller
        one.
        <br>
        Aperture also controls the depth of field. Depth of field is the distance between
        the nearest and farthest that are appears acceptably sharp. The smaller aperture,
        the larger depth of field. The larger aperture, the smaller depth of field. In a
        photo with large depth of filed, the objects that are out of focusing are clear
        compared to a photo with small depth of field. With small depth of field, the background
        will be blurred which can easily direct viewer’s attention toward the subject. But
        people do not always use small depth of field to shoot photo, if the background
        are indispensable for presenting the subject, shooting small depth of field will
        produce more desirable photo. There is no absolutely right or wrong. The photographers
        are free to choose the way they feel the best.<br>

    <h2>
        Shutter speed</h2>
    <p>
        Shutter speed is the length of time that the images sensor inside the camera is
        exposed to light. The typical shutter speeds are:

        <tr>
            <td>
                1/2s

            <td>
                1/15s

            <td>
                1/1000s
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                1/30s

            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        Fast shutter speed allows more light passes through than slow shutter speed. The
        exposure time 1/2s is the half of 1s. Fast shutter speed are used to capture fast
        moving object, such as animals, cars, and athletes. For example, to capture a clear
        image of a moving motorcycle, you probably need a shutter speed of 1/1000s. Otherwise,
        the motorcycle may appear blurred. You can rotate the dial on your camera to change
        the shutter speed.

    <h2>
        ISO</h2>
    <p>
        It refers to the sensitivity of the camera’s sensor. Usually range from 160 to 25600.
        A high ISO will the image sensor to absorb more light. It will help you to shoot
        at a dark environment, but it will create noise at the same time. Noise will reduce
        the image quality. Just like a CD player, if you play it louder you definitely will
        hear more noise. The typical ISO values are:
