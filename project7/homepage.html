        The Key Elements of Good Photo</h1>
    <p>
        With the improvement of mobile phone penetration. We experience a lot of photos
        on the internet. Today, everyone can shoot a photo, but what will let your photo
        stand out? What will make you a good photographer? There are three basic principles
        of a good photo:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A good photo should have a distinct subject, that the subject is very clear and
            unambiguous to the viewer. It can a person, a group of people, a thing, a group
            of things, or a story.</li>
        <li>The viewer’s attention should be directed to the subject of the photo. The viewer
            should able to identify the subject at first glance.</li>
        <li>The frame of the photo should be concise. That anything will distract viewer’s attention
            toward the subject should be eliminated.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>
        When you press your shutter, you should always remind you three questions:</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>What subject am I presenting?</li>
        <li>How could I attract viewer’s attention toward the subject?</li>
        <li>Is there anything will distract viewer’s attention toward the subject?</li>
    </ul>
