    <p>
        There are the four common shooting modes among digital camera. Almost every mirrorless
        camera has these modes. Each of mode will be applicable to different situation.
        I will start introduce the most difficult mode M to the easiest mode P.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>
        Mode M (Manual)</h2>
    <p>
        A commonly used shooting mode for seasoned photographer. It provides the great latitude
        for creative expression. It can be used to shoot various objects. The photographer
        can manually select the aperture and shutter speed. In most mirrorless camera, you
        can set the ISO to manual or auto. I highly recommend beginners to set it on auto.
        It will help you to understand ISO deeply. Mode M can be time consuming for beginners
        but it is the most effective mode to help you to learn photography and form you
        own unique photography style. Simply rotate your mode dial on the camera to M. Focusing
        on the object. Then starts to adjust the aperture, shutter speed and ISO.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>
        Mode A (Aperture-Priority Auto)</h2>
    <p>
        Mode A allows the photographer to select the aperture, and the camera will automatically
        set the shutter speed for optimal exposure. Keep in mind, that is the optimal exposure
        for camera but maybe not the photographer. Photographers have the right to determine
        the optimal exposure. Mode A is often less time consuming. It can be used to shoot
        still or slow-moving object. Such as landscape or pedestrian. Switching to Mode
        A, simply rotate your mode dial to A.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>
        Mode S (Shutter-Priority Auto)</h2>
    <p>
        Mode S allows the photographer to select the shutter speed, and the camera will
        automatically set the aperture for optimal exposure. It is also less time consuming
        just like Mode A because you only have to set one thing. It can be used for shooting
        fast moving object. Such as motorcycles, birds, and athletes. Switching to Mode
        S, simply rotate your mode dial to S.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>
        Mode P (Shutter-Priority Auto)</h2>
    <p>
        The camera will automatically select the aperture and shutter speed for you. But
        the photographer can choose different combination of an aperture and shutter speed
        that produce the same exposure. I do not recommend beginners to use this mode. It
        will restrict your creativity. That the camera will select all the things for you.
        In fact, cameras are not smart as human currently. In order to form a specific photography
        style, you should have more control over the camera.</p>
